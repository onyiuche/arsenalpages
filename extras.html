                                <p> Arsene Wenger is a French football manager and former player. He has been the manager of Arsenal since 1996, where he has since become the club's longest-serving manager and most successful in terms of major titles won.</p>
                                <p>Football pundits give Wenger credit for his contribution to the revolutionising of football in England in the late 1990s through the introduction of changes in the training and diet of players.</p>
                                <p>The nickname "Le Professeur" is used by fans and the British media to reflect Wenger's studious demeanour. His approach to the game emphasises an attacking mentality, with the aim that football ought to be entertaining on the pitch.</p>
                                <p>In the 2013/2014 season, Wenger led Arsenal through the whole EPL season unbeaten, later going through 49 games undefeated, becoming the first team to ever do it. For this Arsenal were awarded a golden trophy.</p>
                                <p>Wenger continues to set records as the club's longest-serving manager - this is his 18th season of a hugely successful era at the helm.</p>

                                    <p>Gunnersaurus Rex is the Arsenal Football Club Mascot. Acording to Arsenal FC websites Gunnersaurus Rex was born in North Bank, Highbury, August 1993. His first debut was on Arsenal vs Coventry City (h) League, in August 14, 1993</p>
                                    <p>Arsenal's resident dino-mascot Gunnersaurus was at the heart of the celebrations after the Gunners FA Cup triumph over Hull City.</p>
                                    <p>The goofy green dinosaur, one of football's best loved mascots, partied with the Arsenal players on the Wembley pitch before squeezing through the sunroof of a Citroen to lead the open-top bus parade through Islington.</p>
                                    <p>Whether he's quietly observing a minute's silence or offering Arsenal players pre-match advice, Gunnersaurus (full name Gunnersaurus Rex) always provides great entertainment.</p>
